0,Donald Trump Is Right to Love the Trump Vaccines,"Former president Donald Trump restated his affinity for the coronavirus vaccines on Sunday during an event with former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly: 'You’re playing right into their hands' when you doubt the vaccine, President Trump says. pic.twitter.com/xJc7JTL0cR — No Spin News (@NoSpinNews) December 20, 2021  By expediting the development and distribution of the coronavirus vaccines, argued Trump, “we saved tens of millions of lives worldwide.” “I think this would have been the Spanish Flu of 1917,” without the advent of the vaccines, said Trump, who also revealed that he had received a booster shot. While Trump has consistently touted the inoculations as an achievement of his administration, he had previously stated his opposition to boosters, calling them a “moneymaking operation for Pfizer.” NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon.

The former president chided those who have cast doubt on the vaccines’ safety and effectiveness, declaring that conservative skeptics are “playing right into” the hands of the Left by castigating the vaccines. On the merits and the politics, Trump’s instincts are incontestably correct. Centers for Disease Control data show significantly reduced death rates among the vaccinated population. And these data likely underestimate the efficacy of the vaccines, since the vaccinated are both larger in number and include a larger proportion of at-risk groups. Transmission rates have not been reduced to the extent we had hoped, but that’s a function of the spread of variants, not an inherent problem with the inoculations. Moreover, 72.5 percent of adults have been fully vaccinated against the disease. Most people believe the vaccines to be an extremely useful — if not foolproof — way to mitigate the consequences of Covid’s continued existence. Placing yourself on the other side of a 70–30 issue is never politically savvy, even if its a moral necessity. In this case, the political incentives align with the moral imperatives. Conservatives, and Trump, are on the right side of so many of the Covid-created controversies of our day. Lockdowns impose immense economic and social harms on Americans while doing little to stamp out the virus in the long term. School closures pass the costs of the pandemic on to the most vulnerable among us. Vaccine mandates are an intolerable imposition on personal liberty. Masks are only helpful on the margins. These postures have already led to electoral success in places like Virginia. It’s about time that some prominent voices on the right abandon their senseless, injurious vaccine skepticism, and learn to love the Trump vaccines.",-1.0

n a recent podcast with Conan O’Brien, the comedian Zach Galifianakis said America’s obsession with celebrity culture was a “mental illness” that explained why we ended up with Donald Trump, a celebrity president. Given how tired and ineffective Joe Biden looks right now as president, my guess is that Republicans will be awfully tempted if Trump presents himself for election in 2024. He’s still more relatable than all other elected Republicans, funnier, and freer to say what he thinks. The problem for Trump is that he’s now all about Trump. He’s lost the political substance of his first campaign and is  … If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.

2,"Trump, Covid, and Despotism","In this sharp AIER piece, Don Boudreaux explores the connections between our 45th president, the Covid pandemic, and the astounding diminution of liberty in America owing to the efforts at stamping out the disease. I think his analysis is right on target: Because state governments that imposed only relatively light Covid restrictions were more likely to be red than blue, and because the mainstream narrative from early on cast Trump with the anti-lockdowners, many people with antipathy to Trump apparently concluded that lockdowns and other Covid restrictions are acceptable for the simple reason that these measures are opposed by Trump and his base. The thinking seems to have been this: To be pro-Trump is to be anti-science, therefore, to be anti-Trump is to be pro-science. And to be pro-science specifically is to be pro-Fauci, Birx, CNN, and the New York Times, because these persons and media are anti-Trump. People reached this conclusion without much investigation of the realities of Covid restrictions, or of Trump’s actual role in affecting a response. Read the whole thing.",-3.9
3,Trump vs. DeSantis,"There has been a spate of reporting about Trump being irked with Ron DeSantis lately. Here’s an example from the New York Times. If Trump actually does run in 2024 (for now, his obvious play is convincing everyone he’s going to run), DeSantis will have a ticklish choice: On the one hand, he may figure that he’s young so he can wait, but it is unlikely that he will retain the status he currently has in the party for years to come; on the other, running in 2024 would run the risk of Trump absolutely shredding his image in the GOP forevermore. I’d guess most — almost all? — potential candidates facing some version of this choice will decide to sit it out if Trump goes for the third time.",6.4

5,Christie v. Trump,"I’m a huge fan of Allahpundit over at Hot Air but don’t find his post speculating about Christie’s motives in attacking Trump very persuasive. Is he angling to be bought off into a future Trump cabinet position, or maybe even Trump’s VP? I think Christie was genuinely appalled by Trump’s post-election conduct, is saying what he thinks, and — yes — is considering a 2024 run, even if Trump gets in. At the moment, what Christie is saying isn’t going to endear him to many Republicans, but it’s true, and there may end up being more of a market for it two or three years from now than people expect right now.",-1.5
6,Joseph Robinette Trump on Immigration?,"The White House has announced an agreement with Mexico to resume the “Remain in Mexico” program for certain illegal-alien “asylum-seekers” starting Monday, December 6. This, combined with other indications of stepped-up immigration enforcement, has caused dissatisfaction among the administration’s anti-borders confederates about Biden presiding over the second Trump term when it comes to immigration. At first blush, this grumbling seems absurd. FY 2021 had the highest number of illegal-alien arrests at the southern border in history, a consequence of a historic surge across our borders. The number of deportations has plummeted. (We have a report coming out next week, based on FOIA’d information, showing an alarming drop even in the number of illegal-alien criminals being deported, at a time when crime is spiking.) Obama’s Central American Minors program has been restarted, to fly certain illegal aliens directly to the U.S. The House of Representatives has passed an amnesty for some 7 million illegal aliens, plus measures to increase legal immigration (though these provisions may yet be stripped out of the budget-reconciliation bill in the Senate). Regulations are in the works to facilitate the immigration of people likely to go on welfare and to dramatically expand asylum. And those are only the high points of the Biden administration’s unprecedented anti-borders campaign. On the other hand, the hard-left activists aren’t totally wrong. In addition to finally restarting Remain in Mexico (albeit in dramatically watered-down form) months after being ordered to do so by a federal judge, the Biden administration has continued limited use of Title 42 expulsions (premised on a public-health emergency), which send people back to Mexico without hearings. What’s more, DHS has been permitted to deport by air some Central American and Haitian families, as my colleague Todd Bensman has reported. Even detention of illegal aliens are up from the very low levels during the worst of the pandemic. NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon. No charge.

These are all half measures. Title 42 expulsions are applied only to single men; most Central American families are still being released into the U.S., not flown home; and even Remain in Mexico will exempt many “asylum-seekers”, including all those from the eastern hemisphere (like these guys), and people claiming to be LGBT etc., which is certain to prompt an explosion of Latin Max Klingers starting next week. But even a little enforcement can make a difference after the open-borders free-for-all since January 20. While October border arrests, at about 5,100 illegal-alien apprehensions per day, were still the highest numbers for that month in a generation, they were down 21 percent from the historic peak in July. This suggests that the anti-borders pragmatists in the White House have gained the upper hand, after the first six or seven months of Biden’s term, when the anti-borders fanatics were in charge. The dissension within the administration over immigration policy is not about the objective, which is de facto unlimited immigration, but about tactics and optics. Even before Biden’s overall approval ratings tanked he was already underwater on immigration with the public — and it’s only gotten worse since. While the Democrats are virtually guaranteed to lose their majority in the House of Representatives next year, they hope to retain the Senate — but that will be impossible if their man in the White House continues to preside over an epic immigration disaster. The administration’s gestures toward border enforcement are unlikely to yield much political benefit. While anything is better than nothing, the enforcement moves’ grudging and half-hearted nature mean they will have only limited effect, doing nothing to change the broad (and accurate) public perception of the administration as hostile to America’s borders and sovereignty. At the same time, outrage among Biden’s hard-left cadres will only grow with each prospective illegal alien who is unable to get in. Break out the popcorn.",-2.0
7,Trump and DeSantis Circling Each Other,"This is getting interesting. Earlier this week, former president Donald Trump took a not-so-veiled shot at Florida governor Ron DeSantis. The Florida governor’s press team had turned away questions about whether DeSantis had received a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot, saying it was a private medical decision. In an interview Trump referred to it: “I watched a couple of politicians be interviewed and one of the questions was, ‘Did you get the booster?’ because they had the vaccine. . . . They’re answering like, in other words, the answer is ‘yes,’ but they don’t want to say it, because they’re gutless.” Now, DeSantis has responded in kind on an episode of the Ruthless podcast that was just released. DeSantis says one of his biggest regrets was not speaking out “louder” on Trump admin calls for lock down during the pandemic. “And I think it knowing now what I know, then if if that was a threat earlier, I would have been much louder.” About 32 mins in: https://t.co/HaR1MOfHWY — Manu Raju (@mkraju) January 14, 2022  I think both men would prefer to avoid a direct confrontation right now, but this is an interesting matchup. Trump still has the instincts and comedic chops to harm just about any Republican’s political fortunes. But since Trump’s defeat, if not earlier, ending Covid restrictions has become the most important issue for Republicans — touching the economic issues facing small businesses, school closures, mask and vaccine mandates. And DeSantis has been their de facto national leader on this issue, while Trump is sending out incomprehensible press releases about evidence of fraud.",-3.2
8,Trump’s Bad Night,"November 2 was a boffo night for the Republican Party, and not such a great night for Donald Trump. It’s not as though the interests of the two are diametrically opposed, but they are in tension. To the extent that the GOP shows that it can thrive without former President Trump being on the ballot or even at the center of attention, it undermines the idea that he, and only he, knows the secret to Republican success. Glenn Youngkin’s victory in the Virginia gubernatorial election is a particular threat. There’s no doubt that the former Carlyle Group CEO assembled a geographic and demographic coalition — heavily rural and non-college-educated — that reflects a change that Trump accelerated and cemented, and that Youngkin’s full-throated attack on critical race theory showed an unapologetic attitude to cultural politics with Trumpian overtones. Fundamentally, though, Youngkin did it his own way and still turned out Trump voters in droves, while eroding Terry McAuliffe’s margins in areas where the Democratic advantage once seemed insurmountable. Youngkin’s path to victory was one that Trump himself or any of his epigones would have been incapable of. For Trump, being radioactive had its uses. It meant he’d dominate news cycles, which he considered good in and of itself, and bonded his base even more strongly to him. Youngkin thoroughly rejected this model. His approach from the beginning was to soften his image, assuming that base Republican voters would support him, even if he was branded as a nice guy and voters otherwise not willing to listen to a Republican would give him a chance. He was right. NR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon. No charge. Get Jim Geraghty’s tour of the political news of the day. Get Kevin D. Williamson’s newsletter delivered to your inbox each Tuesday. A weekly digest on business and economics from an NR sensibility. With all the focus on critical race theory, it’s easy to forget that exit polls showed that the economy was the top issue in the campaign. Youngkin emphasized the cost of living, and according to the Washington Post, won among voters who cared most about the economy, 55–44 percent. It is undoubtedly true that Youngkin wouldn’t have prevailed without hitting education hard, and that critical race theory is a winning cultural issue for the GOP. But Youngkin’s position on education was more complicated than sometimes acknowledged. What first brought education to prominence was widespread school closures during the pandemic, and a key part of Youngkin’s message was increasing educational standards and paying teachers more — positions with obvious appeal to the center. There is no doubt that Trump brought a new cultural combativeness to the GOP, sensed a hunger among the party’s voters for new departures on immigration and trade, and won the presidency in 2016 based on an electoral map few thought possible. But Trump has lived off the legend of 2016 — only he knows how to win or fight, and he holds the key to a working-class-based electoral coalition that no one else understands as instinctively or as well. Trump’s image as the wizard of winning was always doubtful. In 2016, some Republican Senate candidates notably outperformed him in their states. In 2020, Republican House candidates did the same. Trump’s magic was to a large extent based on running against a very unpopular candidate, Hillary Clinton, and in a race where he could lean on the Electoral College. He never had to aim for 50 percent +1, but 46 percent and just the right breaks in the battleground states. This is not a sustainable or readily replicable model. Now, Youngkin, who at the end of the day is a Glenn Youngkin Republican, exceeded Trump’s 2020 margins in the reddest parts of Virginia. In Southside Virginia, Trump won by 22 points; Youngkin won by 36. In Southwest Virginia, Trump won by 45, Youngkin by 53. And so on. Worried that he’s not getting enough credit for Virginia, Trump said afterward that there’s no way Youngkin would have won without MAGA voters. True enough. Youngkin needed to get them out and did, without Trump campaigning for him and barely mentioning his name. Therein lies a tale. © 2021 by King Features Syndicate",3.5

he fullness of time, and now the Omicron wave, have made it obvious how preposterously over-the-top and unfair the chief lines of criticism against Donald Trump were during the pandemic.

Chris Hayes a couple of months ago called for a truth-and-reconciliation-commission-type inquiry into how Trump “willfully got hundreds of thousands of people killed.” Willfully!
