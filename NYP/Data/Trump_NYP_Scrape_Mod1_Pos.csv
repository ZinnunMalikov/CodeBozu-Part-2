0,Joe Biden spent a quarter of his first year as president in Delaware,"President Biden spent 28 percent of his first year as commander in chief back home in Delaware, worrying transparency advocates who note that he exempted his homes from visitor log disclosure. Biden, who returns to the White House on Monday night from his house in Wilmington, simply likes being home, his press representatives say. But critics are concerned about who may be seeking to influence public policy over dinner — or breakfast —  in Biden’s sun room. “Generally speaking, the American people have a right to know what the president is up to. This president specifically changed policy to presumably disclose who’s been visiting the White House,” said Tom Fitton, president of conservative legal group Judicial Watch, which has for years battled for White House visitor log transparency. “The decision to keep secret who is visiting Delaware makes a mockery of that transparency. It turns it into a joke,” Fitton said. Biden spent at least part of 101 days of his first year in office in Delaware — almost always at either his primary residence in Wilmington or his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach. Despite vowing to lead the most transparent administration yet, Biden is increasingly taking flak for being out of public view while giving fewer interviews and press conferences than predecessors. He will give his second solo White House press conference Wednesday — the final day of his first year in office. The Biden White House initially applauded itself last year for resuming the partial release of visitor logs, saying in May, “These logs give the public a look into the visitors entering and exiting the White House campus for appointments, tours, and official business — making good on President Biden’s commitment to restore integrity, transparency, and trust in government.” But White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki clarified to The Post in August that there would be no visitor logs released from Biden’s Delaware residences. “I can confirm we are not going to be providing information about the comings and goings of the president’s grandchildren or people visiting him in Delaware,” Psaki said. The Obama administration in 2009 began releasing some visitor logs as a matter of policy to resolve lawsuits from the liberal group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Former President Donald Trump in 2017 discontinued the practice, calling it phony transparency due to officials redacting many names. Presidents can pick and choose what they reveal about visitor logs thanks to an appeals court ruling that Attorney General Merrick Garland wrote as a judge in 2013. Garland wrote that a president’s constitutional right to confidential communications means that the Freedom of Information Act doesn’t apply to visitor logs held by the Secret Service. The Trump White House made full use of Garland’s ruling to abandon disclosure of logs. Then-White House communications director Michael Dubke said Trump’s decision was made in part due to “the grave national security risks and privacy concerns of the hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.” Transparency advocates argue that presidential visitor logs reviewable under FOIA and that any national security or privacy concerns could be addressed with specific legally defined redactions. Psaki’s announcement that Biden would exempt his home from visitor log transparency triggered concern about who first son Hunter Biden might be bringing to dinner. “[Joe Biden] is the one who had Hunter at the vice president’s office meeting with his business partners,” Fitton said at the time. By Biden’s own admission, he sometimes talks policy with his son, who has an array of foreign clients that present conflicts of interest. The president said in November that he consulted with his son ahead of a climate change conference in Scotland. The links between the elder Biden and his son’s business ventures often are murky. For example, it’s unclear if they have discussed his new art career in which Hunter hopes to fetch as much as $500,000 from anonymous buyers for his novice artwork, which experts say is open to potential influence-peddling. Hunter bagged at least $375,000 for five print at a Hollywood art show attended by one of his father’s ambassador nominees, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Hunter Biden’s attorney Chris Clark said less than a week after President Biden’s November summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping that the first son divested a 10 percent stake in an investment fund controlled by Chinese state-owned entities. Hunter Biden and the White House provided no further details. That firm, BHR Partners, was registered 12 days after the then-second son joined Vice President Biden aboard Air Force Two for a 2013 trip to Beijing. Trump’s defense team at his 2020 impeachment trial cited Obama-era visitor logs that indicated Biden met with his son’s business partner Devon Archer around the time Hunter Biden joined the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he earned a reported $1 million per year. Trump attorney Pam Bondi argued that Trump should not have been impeached for pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens because  the elder Biden may have had his own hand in the deal. Photos and emails published by The Post indicate that Joe Biden in 2015 hosted his son and a group of Mexican business associates at the vice president’s official residence. In 2016, Hunter Biden apparently emailed one of those associates while aboard Air Force Two for an official visit to Mexico, complaining that he hadn’t received reciprocal business favors. “I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the F’ing White House and the Vice President’s house and the inauguration,” he griped. And documents and photos from the laptop indicate Joe Biden attended a 2015 DC dinner with a group of his son’s associates — including a trio of Kazakhs and the Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina and her husband, ex-Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov. A Senate report released last year said a firm linked to Hunter Biden received $3.5 million from Baturina in 2014. A photo depicts Joe Biden posing with the Kazakhstani group at the dinner and one day after the gathering, Burisma executive Vadym Pozharskyi emailed the then-second son to thank him for the opportunity to meet his father. Biden’s weekends away continue Trump’s habit of generally leaving the White House on Friday — in a break from the habits of former President Barack Obama, who made the White House home. Trump typically held court at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., or his golf course in Bedminster, NJ.",2.9
1,The left politicized COVID from the start,"From the moment COVID-19 appeared, the pandemic became inseparable from politics. Political frenzy was inevitable since the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have escaped from a level-4-security virology lab in Wuhan, China. The rapid-fire spread soon threatened to indict the Chinese Communist government for nearly destroying the world economy and killing millions. Western elites, in response, feared that their own lucrative investments in China would be jeopardized by such disclosures — and so acted accordingly in defending Beijing. Nonetheless, one scenario that remains intriguing is that the escaped virus was birthed by gain-of-function research scientists, overseen by elements of the Chinese Communist military. Worse, the lab was given subsidies by US health authorities, routed through third parties. Hiding all that damaging information warped government policy and media coverage. Belatedly, a panicked China shut down all domestic travel in and out of Wuhan — but not flights abroad to Western Europe and the United States. The rest is history. From the outset, the World Health Organization simply spread false talking points about the outbreak from the Chinese government, delaying a robust global response. Former President Donald Trump’s political opponents initially told Americans to shop and travel as usual — only to pivot as cases mounted and they blamed the president. The US 2020 ban on travel from China was met with charges of racism and xenophobia from presidential candidates. Ironically, many were simply channeling racist and xenophobic China’s propaganda. Many doctors kept hammering the need for therapeutics, including taboo off-label use of cheap generic drugs. The use of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin was widely ridiculed, despite continuing studies from abroad attesting to their usefulness. Trump’s Operation Warp Speed project to develop vaccinations was also pilloried. Candidates Kamala Harris and Joe Biden did their best to talk down the safety of the impending inoculations. But once in power, they projected their own prior harmful rhetoric onto so-called “anti-vaxxers.” Then they claimed credit for the initial success of the Trump vaccinations. The Pfizer corporation had promised a major pre-election announcement about its likely rollout of a vaccine in October, just days before the 2020 election. Then, mysteriously, Pfizer claimed the vaccine, in fact, would not be ready before Nov. 3. A few days after the election of Joe Biden, the company reversed course and announced the vaccinations would soon be available. Then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo obstructed most all federal help with Trump’s fingerprints on it. That way Cuomo became a media, Emmy-winning darling — before resigning in disgrace. Cuomo’s policies of steering infected patients into long-term-care facilities doomed more than 10,000 of the elderly. New York is now illegally using race to grant preferences in the allotments of tests and new drugs. The rhetoric of the media-progressive nexus that mandatory, massive lockdowns were necessary all but destroyed a booming Trump economy and denied critical medical care to millions. Emphasizing therapeutics, natural herd immunity and the resilience of the youth to the disease were all pronounced “anti-science” by the demagogues on the left. Various celebrities and politicos — such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton — boasted the pandemic lockdown offered the perfect crisis that must not go to waste politically. Actress Jane Fonda even crowed that COVID-19 was “God’s gift to the left” in helping to end Donald Trump. In the waning days of the 2022 campaign, Biden went so far as to blame Trump personally for all the deaths from the virus. Once the vaccinations had seemed to work in early 2021, an upbeat Joe Biden boasted that he would end the virus by summer 2021, by following “the science.” He went so far as to claim that no one had been vaccinated prior to his inauguration even though 17 million, including Biden himself, had been. Then Nemesis answered such hubris. The unforeseen Delta and Omicron variants hit. A new phrase, “breakthrough case,” revealed that the vaccinations often could only prevent serious illness but not infection or infectiousness. Suddenly the best and brightest people with three shots, who had blasted the red-state rubes as the ignorant un-vaxxed, got sick. More have now died from the virus on Biden’s than on Trump’s watch. A warped economy amid renewed COVID-19 outbreaks helped to further destroy Biden’s waning popularity. In reaction, the left now calls for realism, emphasis on treatments and acknowledgment of the value of natural immunities. It is even newly curious about the origins of the virus and the need to “get back to normal.” We are suddenly told that thousands had died “with” rather than “because” of COVID — the exact opposite of what we heard in the Trump era. A skeptic might suggest terror over the impending midterms finally made the left face reality. Politicizing the pandemic is a euphemism. In truth, thousands of Americans have died needlessly because of weaponized disinformation about China’s culpability, vaccines, useful drugs, lockdowns, racial preferences and long-term-care facilities.",12.0
2,"'A moral moment': Warnock slams Manchin, Sinema for spiking filibuster change","Sen. Raphael Warnock on Monday slammed fellow Democrats who have vowed to vote against altering or eliminating this filibuster this week in order to pass two pieces of voting rights legislation. During an interview on “The View” with co-host Joy Behar, Warnock was pressed on the Democratic push to alter or eliminate the filibuster, a move that will likely fail due to key opposition from Moderate Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-WV.) “Is there any convincing these holdouts? What are these people protecting?” Behar said, asking how Democrats can ensure the passage of the voting rights bills. The Georgia Democrat — who currently serves as the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. served as pastor up until his assassination — harshly criticized those who have expressed their opposition and appeared to claim that they would have been on the wrong side of history during the civil rights movement. “Well, you know, as you might imagine, as the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, people ask me all the time, especially this time of year as we celebrate his birth, ‘What would Dr. King have done? Where would he stand in a moment like this?’ And especially people like me, born after the civil rights movement, we ask ourselves what would we have done then? I submit members of the Senate, regardless of their party, no longer have to ask what we would have done then,” Warnock said. “We’re doing whatever we would have done then right now. This is a moral moment. This is a 1965 moment, because what they’ve done is they have removed the protections that we secured in 1965, and we’ve seen the mushrooming in all of these terrible voter suppression laws all across the country.” While Sinema has argued that changing the Senate rules would cause further division among the two parties, Warnock accused similar “arguments around procedure” of being the reason segregation and slavery lasted so long. “I submit that is not because, you know, you had only folks who were angry and hateful. Often you had these kinds of arguments around procedure around precedent around bipartisanship, and somehow the humanity of the most marginalized members of our country got lost,” he said. Warnock emphasized that the voting rights legislation must pass “no matter what,” adding that “our country is on the brink of peril.” The Georgia lawmaker’s stern warning comes one week after President Biden delivered a harsh address promoting filibuster reform in a failed effort to convince the disagreeing Democrats. During his remarks, the president described the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as a “coup” attempt and alleged that Republican-led states are passing voting restrictions to reduce participation because of former President Donald Trump’s claims of voter fraud, which were rejected by courts. He then went on to liken members of Congress to George Wallace, Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis — infamous white supremacists. The speech was met with much criticism from Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who equated the “unpresidential” address to a “rant.” “I have known, liked, and personally respected Joe Biden for many years. I did not recognize the man at that podium yesterday,” McConnell said, adding that the speech amounted to “shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist unless he gets whatever he wants.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki later insisted that the president did not mean to label his fellow lawmakers as white supremacists, but “was comparing the choice to those figures in history and where they’re going to position themselves as they determine whether they’re going to support the fundamental right to vote or not.” Days later, Biden traveled to the Capitol in another effort to get Sinema and Manchin on board. However, less than an hour before Biden was scheduled to arrive, Sinema delivered a nearly 20-minute long speech outlining her opposition to changing the Senate rules. Given the overall Republican opposition, it would be near-impossible for Democrats to pass the voting rights bills with a 60-vote majority leading Democrats to look into changing Senate rules and eliminating the filibuster to bypass the threshold. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer originally planned to hold a vote on the rules change by Jan. 17, but pushed it back after Sinema’s speech. Despite the vote being essentially dead without the two moderate senators’ support, the New York Democrat cited “circumstances regarding COVID and another potentially hazardous winter storm approaching the DC area” as the reason behind the delay.",1.6
3,Harris says Senate Dems 'must pass' voting rights bills or risk being 'complicit',"Vice President Kamala Harris, in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech that appeared targeted at a pair of fellow Democrats, called on senators to pass stalled voting rights bills or be “complicit” in disenfranchising people. Harris’ stern pitch for the seemingly fated bills on Monday follows President Biden’s controversial speech last week that likened Republican senators to racists for blocking the legislation. “[King] pushed for racial justice, for economic justice and for the freedom that unlocks all others, the freedom to vote. Today, our freedom to vote is under assault,” Harris said in web-streamed remarks. “In Georgia and across our nation, anti-voter laws are being passed that could make it more difficult for as many as 55 million Americans to vote — 55 million Americans. That is one out of six people in our country.” She added: “The proponents of these laws are not only putting in place obstacles to the ballot box, they are also working to interfere with our elections to get the outcomes they want and to discredit those they do not. That is not how democracies work. We know the threat we face.” Later Monday, Harris was asked by a reporter for her message to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-WVa.), who openly oppose scrapping current Senate filibuster rules. “As I’ve said before, there are a hundred members of the United States Senate, and I’m not going to absolve — nor should any of us — absolve any member of the United States Senate from taking on a responsibility to follow through on the oath that they all took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States,” Harris said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is preparing to call a vote as early as this week on rule changes that would allow federal election reforms to bypass the usual 60-vote threshold for legislation to proceed. But the effort is doomed due to opposition from centrists to allowing for a bare majority in the evenly divided Senate, where Harris breaks ties. In her MLK Day speech, Harris said, “last week, the president and I visited Atlanta to deliver a message: It is time for the United States Senate to do its job.” Harris specifically mentioned the House-passed Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act , which combined the provisions of two large Senate bills. “This bill represents the first real opportunity to secure the freedom to vote since the US Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act nearly a decade ago. And the Senate must pass this bill now,” she said. “As Dr. King said, the only normalcy you would accept is a normalcy that recognizes the dignity and worth of all God’s children. Today, we must not be complacent or complicit. We must not give up. And we must not give in.” Biden’s speech calling on the Senate to set aside the legislative filibuster flopped as Republicans took issue with his rhetoric likening them to George Wallace and Jefferson Davis. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called it “profoundly unpresidential.” Meanwhile, Sinema and Manchin restated their opposition to lowering the threshold to 50 votes, meaning the rule change pushed by Biden, Harris and Schumer cannot go forward. “What is the legislative filibuster, other than a tool that requires new federal policy to be broadly supported by senators representing a broader cross-section of Americans?” Sinema said on the Senate floor. “A guardrail, inevitably viewed as an obstacle by whoever holds the Senate majority; but which in reality ensures that millions of Americans represented by the minority party have a voice in the process.” Manchin said in a statement after her speech, “Ending the filibuster would be the easy way out. I cannot support such a perilous course for this nation when elected leaders are sent to Washington to unite our country by putting politics and party aside.” Biden claimed in his controversial speech that “forces that attempted a coup” were behind recent laws in GOP-led states, referring to last year’s Capitol riot, which disrupted certification of his victory in the Electoral College. “Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?  Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?  Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Biden said. McConnell, who repeatedly condemned the voter fraud claims that Biden said propelled the state changes, slammed Biden’s speech as “unpresidential” and a “rant.” “I have known, liked, and personally respected Joe Biden for many years. I did not recognize the man at that podium yesterday,” McConnell said. Biden was “shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist unless he gets whatever he wants,” McConnell said. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Biden was going “down the same tragic road taken by President [Donald] Trump casting doubt on the reliability of American elections.” Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, voted to convict Trump in two Senate impeachment trials and harshly criticized him during the 2016 campaign. Republicans generally defend the recent state election laws as attempts to reduce fraud and end COVID-19 pandemic policies that expanded mail-in voting, and they argue that administering elections is a state responsibility. Critics also say Biden has misrepresented the state laws. The Washington Post gave Biden “Four Pinocchios” in April for falsely describing the Georgia law’s impact on voting hours. The Georgia law doesn’t alter Election Day hours but expands early voting by adding a second mandatory Saturday. It affirms that counties can open for early voting on two Sundays and allows counties to extend early voting hours beyond normal business hours. Democrats oppose provisions that require a photo ID to get an absentee ballot, shorten the window of time to vote absentee and allow state officials to take over local election offices in response to alleged misconduct. The Biden-backed legislation would force certain states to gain federal approval for changes to election laws, responding to a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that reduced post-civil rights era oversight. It would make Election Day a holiday, require states to allow same-day voter registration and no-excuse mail-in voting and mandate two weeks of in-person early voting before an election. It would bar states from requiring people to show ID to get a mail-in ballot.",3.8
4,"Party preferences shifted from Dems to GOP in 2021, survey finds","​Americans’ political preferences shifted​ dramatically over 2021, swinging from a nine percentage-point lead for Democrats at the beginning of the year to ending with a five-point advantage for Republicans, according to a poll released Monday. ​ ​In the first quarter of 2021, 49 percent of Americans said they identified as a Democrat or leaned Democratic, while 40 percent identified as Republican or leaned Republican, according to a Gallup survey. ​​ The Democrats’ lead over the GOP was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2012.​​ The percentage​ for Democrats remained unchanged at 49 percent going into the second quarter, but the percentage for Republicans ticked up three percentage points. Then in the third quarter, Republicans topped Democrats — 45 percent to 44 percent — a trend that continued through the final three months of 2021.​ Republicans ended the year with a 47 percent to 42 percent advantage over Democrats. ​ The reversal appears to track President Biden’s downward slide in the polls that began in July and August because of the disastrous US military withdrawal from Afghanistan and the sputtering economy — a decline that culminated in record low numbers for Biden by the end of the year. ​The pollster noted that the GOP has held a five-point ​lead in only four quarters since it began measuring party identification in 1991, one of them occurring after the 1994 midterm elections when Republicans gained control of Congress for the first time since 1952. Gallup attributed the shifting preferences to the changing poll numbers over the year for Biden and former President Donald Trump. ​​While Trump’s job approval ratings fell to 34 percent in January — the lowest of his term — Biden was enjoying ratings in the mid-50s after his inauguration on Jan. 20. ​​ By December, Biden’s job approval ratings had plummeted to around ​40 percent, brought down by a surge in coronavirus cases, increasing inflation and a stalled legislative agenda. The survey results are based on aggregated data from ​interviews with 12,000 randomly sampled adults during the year, Gallup said.",2.8
5,Hard-hitting journalist who investigated Jeffrey Epstein dead at 78,"Hard-hitting investigative journalist and former NYPD detective John Connolly passed away on Saturday at 78. The cop-turned-scribe was known among media insiders for his unending Rolodex, and a unique ability to mix among Hollywood execs and stars, Wall Street rainmakers, pols, police and wiseguys alike. Connolly was a co-author with James Patterson of the 2017 book “Filthy Rich: The Shocking True Story of Jeffrey Epstein — The Billionaire’s Sex Scandal,” which was turned into a Netflix series. He was also a contributor during his career to magazines including Spy, Vanity Fair, Premiere, US Weekly, Radar and New York, and penned prominent pieces on Steven Seagal, Heidi Fleiss, Donald Trump, Michael Jackson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others. He’d also appeared in the documentary “Who Killed Jeffrey Epstein?” for Investigation Discovery. Connolly told The Post in 2020 of his findings on Epstein over the years: “Like all good grifters, he had ways of moving people in directions where they shouldn’t go … Once they did, they were screwed.” As an author, Connolly had been working on a new book on infamous LA private eye Anthony Pellicano to be called “The Sin Eater.” Pellicano was released in 2019 from federal prison after 16 years behind bars for wiretapping and racketeering. Before Pellicano was incarcerated, he’d worked for some of Hollywood’s biggest names, including late Paramount studio boss Brad Grey, former CAA power agent Michael Ovitz, and the “King of Pop” himself, Jackson. A pal recalled that when Pellicano once confronted Connolly, the tough-as-nails author with a wry wit told him: “Meet me at [famed store] Book Soup in LA, bring your Spalding, I’m bringing my Louisville Slugger.” Connolly’s longtime partner, music industry veteran Dorothy Carvello, confirmed to The Post that Connolly passed after a brief illness. There will be a memorial service this spring.",2.3
6,VP Harris appointee to meet with Latino lawmakers over resurfaced immigration tweets,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly appointed communications director will meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus this week to discuss old tweets of his that resurfaced this month about undocumented immigrants. Jamal Simmons, 50, who was named to his new position in the first week of January, is set to meet virtually with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Thursday, sources told CBS News. Simmons had received backlash from pundits and politicians on both sides of the aisle for several tweets from 2010, which appeared to call for the deportation of undocumented immigrants. “Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC. One Law student the other a protester. Can someone explain why ICE is not picking them up?” he wrote in November 2010. “I’ll try this again,” read another tweet posted the same day. “Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC and have a serious legal question. Why wouldn’t ICE pick them up?” “We shld harden borders & ease visas/find ways to bring undocumented into legal status/punish employers. My  was common sense one,” Simmons insisted in a third tweet. Simmons has since apologized for the tweets, explaining that during his experience as a pundit, he “tweeted a lot of and spoken out on public issues.” “As a pundit for much of my career I have tweeted a lot and spoken out on public issues. Sometimes I have been sarcastic, unclear, or just plainly missed the mark,” he said in a statement. “I sincerely apologize for offending those who care as much as I do about making America the best, multi-ethnic, diverse democracy it can be.  I know the role I am taking on is to represent the Biden-Harris administration, and I will do so with humility, sincerity and respect.” Since the tweets have resurfaced, several Latino lawmakers are looking to chat with the vice president’s communications director, calling his remarks “stunning.” “The statements that Jamal made were just stunning, beyond stunning. Words cannot describe my feelings,” Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) told Axios, adding that he might ask Simmons if he is a President Donald Trump supporter. “I am being public about it, because he was public. He was honest. And I am being honest. And that’s what the public deserves.” People familiar with the matter told the outlet that Correa, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Reps. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.) and Norma Torres (D-Calif.) are the key lawmakers offended by the posts. A White House official confirmed the plans for the Thursday meeting to CBS News, noting that the meeting was “mutually agreed.” Other past tweets and statements from Simmons have also raised questions after some revealed the long-time Democratic aide repeatedly insisted that President George W. Bush’s first presidential election victory was “illegitimate.”",3.2
7,Celebrated Tuskegee Airman Charles McGee dies peacefully at 102,"Charles McGee, a decorated military pilot with the pioneering all-black Tuskegee Airman who flew combat missions in three wars, died Sunday. He was 102. McGee died peacefully in his sleep, his family said in a statement obtained by Reuters. “He had his right hand over his heart and was smiling serenely,” his youngest daughter Yvonne McGee said in a statement released by the spokesperson. McGee flew 409 fighter combat missions during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars. His illustrious career began with the Army Air Corps in 1942, when at the age of 23 he became one of the first black military aviators known as the Tuskegee Airmen. He was among only a few pilots to fly missions in all three wars. “You could say that one of the things we were fighting for was equality. Equality of opportunity. We knew we had the same skills, or better,″ he told The Associated Press in a 1995 interview. Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin reacted to McGee’s death on Twitter, calling him an American hero. After turning 100, McGee was promoted to the one-star rank of brigadier general under a congressional measure signed by then-President Donald Trump McGee is survived by his three children, 10 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.

8,"Dems are using the Capitol riot to hunt political foes, not real threats: Devine","The Texas synagogue siege Saturday highlights the risk to Americans of the Biden administration’s singular obsession with targeting Trump supporters as domestic terrorists. Thankfully, the FBI hostage rescue team did a stellar job rescuing the hostages, with the only fatality being the hostage-taker, a recently arrived Pakistani-born British Muslim demanding the release of a jailed anti-Semitic terrorist, dubbed “Lady al Qaeda.” It is a shame that their great work was immediately overshadowed by the absurd, PC pronouncement of senior FBI officials and President Biden that no one knew the motive of the terrorist, Malik Faisal Akram. But the attack is a reminder of times in the not-so-distant past, when Islamist terrorism was considered a threat greater than a MAGA supporter, and the national security apparatus was deployed to protect American citizens, not attack them. Now the Biden administration has flipped it all around to target the Democratic Party’s political opponents, or anyone who displays anti-authority tendencies. Biden last week called such Americans, even senators who oppose his party’s power grab on election laws, “domestic enemies,” and likened them to slave owners and segregationists. From his first day in office, he has labeled supporters of former President Donald Trump “white supremacists” and “domestic terrorists.” It appears to be his only animating ideology. But now that he has tasked the FBI to chase down conservatives, it is not unreasonable to ask if the organization has taken its eye off the infiltration into the country of a terrorist like Akram. When the feds are busy rounding up MAGA grandmothers and Capitol paraders, are they paying attention to the potential terrorist magnet provided by the porous southern border? We know that at least two Yemeni nationals on the FBI’s terrorism watch list were apprehended in separate incidents last year after illegally crossing from Mexico into California, and that Yuma Sector Chief Border Patrol Agent Chris Clem in December announced the apprehension of a “potential terrorist” from Saudi Arabia who had illegally crossed into Arizona. So the threat is still real. As polls keep plummeting in this first anniversary week of Biden’s presidency, instead of easing voter fears about border security, inflation, COVID, crime, and even the basic competence of the administration, Democrats are strategically preoccupied with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. From the partisan congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 to the Department of Justice targeting parents at school board meetings as “domestic terrorists,” the narrative that conservatives are an existential threat is the Democrats’ only blueprint for success in 2022. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has described Trump and GOP lawmakers as “enemies of the state.” The DOJ’s new domestic terrorism unit, which was revealed last week during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, targets people who are anti-authority. To underline the unit’s purpose, specifically to target Republicans, the Democratic chairman of the committee, Sen. Dick Durbin, played video of the Jan. 6 riot at the beginning of proceedings while declaring the committee must “use this hearing to explicitly condemn the use or threat of violence to advance political goals.” The government’s National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism unveiled last year is similarly tailored to Democratic preoccupations, peppered as it is with words such as “equity,” “racism” and “white nationalists.” It categorizes as domestic terrorists anyone who questions the 2020 election results or opposes COVID restrictions. When Attorney General Merrick Garland unveiled the strategy last year, he said it was precipitated by a “large and heinous attack … the January 6 assault on our nation’s Capitol … We have now … an enormous task ahead, to move forward as a country, to punish the perpetrators, [and] to do everything possible to prevent similar attacks.” In other words, the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is being used as a pretext to weaponize the national security apparatus against conservatives in what investigative journalist Julie Kelly describes as a new “domestic war on terror.” This dangerously cynical strategy is the premise of Kelly’s powerful new book “January 6: How Democrats Used the Capitol Protest to Launch a War on Terror Against the Political Right.” She lays out the federal government’s extraordinary repression of American citizens, dozens of whom remain behind bars in DC without trial for Jan. 6 activity, despite not being charged with violent offenses. In dozens of interviews with Jan. 6 prisoners and their families, she reports the pressure placed on them by judges and court-appointed lawyers to recant their support for Trump. Their trials are scheduled for later this year, in the heat of the midterm elections. Kelly has uncovered a “shocking dual system of justice based on political differences and a thirst for power.” As an example of the dual system of justice, the DOJ has charged more than 725 people for their alleged roles in the Jan. 6 riot. But last week the DOJ said the FBI had arrested just 250 people for the seven months of BLM-Antifa riots that convulsed American cities in the lead-up to the 2020 election. After a year of research, Kelly has concluded that as appalling as it was, the Capitol riot was neither an insurrection nor an armed insurrection. “Those who brought weapons … took steps ahead of time to make sure they would not violate D.C.’s strict gun control laws … “Nor did the protesters intend or seek to overthrow the US government; to the contrary, Trump supporters later expressed sincere disappointment that the pockets of violence halted attempts to pursue an audit of the election.” But “the ongoing investigation into the Capitol breach will continue to wreak revenge on Trump supporters [while] Pelosi’s January 6 select committee will create an ongoing political drama aimed at vilifying anyone in Trump’s orbit who can be tied to the purported ‘insurrection.’” This is how the Democrats plan to win the midterms, by demonizing and intimidating their political opponents with government power while attempting to mess with voting rules. The polls suggest their plan is falling flat.",6.8
9,Ex-Clinton adviser says there's 'good chance' of 2024 Hillary/Trump rematch,"​Dick Morris, a onetime top adviser to former President Bill Clinton, says there’s a “good chance” of a 2024 rematch between Hillary Clinton and ex-President Donald Trump. Morris said Sunday that if Democrats lose control of Congress in the 2022 midterm elections, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will be toast — paving the way for a second Hillary bid, with husband Bill playing an architect to her strategy. “There’s a good chance of it,” said Morris, referring to a Hillary-Trump rematch, to John Catsimatidis on the radio host’s WABC show. “Hillary has set up a brilliant strategy that nobody else is able to do,” Morris added. “Knowing the people around her, I believe there is only one person capable of that level of thinking — and that’s her husband, Bill. “The second the election is over … every Democrat is going to take a shot at Biden and Harris. They will be DOA,” Morris said. Meanwhile, at a time when no Democrats are publicly criticizing Biden, Clinton has been warning her party about aligning itself with the policies of progressive Democrats. ​”She has set up a zero-sum game where the worse [Biden] does, the better she does, because she’s positioned herself as the Democratic alternative to Biden. Not just to Biden, but to the extreme left in the Democratic Party,” Morris said. “The person who staked out the turf first and owns the turf in the Democratic Party is going to be Hillary. It’s a brilliant, brilliant strategy​,” Morris said.​ In an interview with MSNBC, Hillary, the former secretary of state in the Obama administration, cautioned Democrats to take time for “some careful thinking” about winning elections, “not just in deep-blue districts where a Democrat and a liberal Democrat, or so-called progressive Democrat, is going to win.” Morris said, “She was right about that. “She staked out a ground, not on ideological issues, but on pragmatism.” Clinton in the MSNBC interview also took a shot at the Biden administration’s struggle to pass legislation in a Democratic-controlled Congress. While she said she was “all about vigorous debate … at the end of the day, it means nothing if we don’t have a Congress that will get things done and we don’t have a White House that we can count on to be sane and sober and stable and productive.” An op-ed last week in the Wall Street Journal made the case for a 2024 Clinton run, saying the poor poll numbers for Biden and Harris, as well as Harris’ own unpopularity, could open the door for the former first lady. “She is already in an advantageous position to become the 2024 Democratic nominee,” wrote Democratic political consultant Doug Schoen and former Manhattan Borough President Andrew Stein about the 74-year-old Clinton. “She is an experienced national figure who is younger than Mr. Biden and can offer a different approach from the disorganized and unpopular one the party is currently taking.” And last week, Politico reported that Hillary and her husband see an opening to return to prominence in the Democratic Party in the squabbling between moderates and progressives over Biden’s legislative agenda that has doomed the Build Back Better social-spending plan and election reforms. “It’s a perpetual itch that will never go away,” one insider told the site of the Clintons’ desire to have Hillary return to political office. “They know how to slowly re-enter. The Clintons want to reset the board in their favor and then move the pieces.” Trump hasn’t said he intends to run again in 2024, but he routinely bests other potential Republican candidates in polls. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey, 54 percent of Republicans picked Trump as their top choice, far above the 11 percent who chose Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",6.9
10,"Letters to the Editor — Jan. 17, 2022","The Issue: The Supreme Court overturning President Biden’s vaccine mandates for large businesses. In the coming months, thousands of American citizens will join almost a million other Americans who lost their lives to COVID-19 (“Biden ‘shot’ down,” Jan. 14). We expect President Biden to do everything he can to prevent our family, neighbors and friends from dying of this horrible disease. The Supreme Court decision preventing the president from mandating vaccinations makes it difficult for him to succeed in beating COVID and saving lives. Don’t blame the president when someone you know who hasn’t been vaccinated dies from COVID-19. He tried. Paul Feiner Greenburgh According to the reasoning of the minority opinion of the Supreme Court on the vaccine mandate, any government official who is assigned responsibility to deal with anything that the government decides is an emergency is free to enact any rule he or she wants. Does this make any sense in a democratic republic governed by a Constitution? Why not just have a monarch who can do as he or she pleases? Robert Solomon Boynton Beach, Fla. The clear winners in the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for most employees are those whose overarching goal is to bring down the president and ensure that he accomplishes as little as possible, so that he may be labeled a failure. For the rest of us, the court’s decision is a bitter pill to swallow at a time that the virus continues to rage and hospitals in multiple areas of the country are overrun with patients, placing enormous strain on our now-forgotten health-care-worker heroes. If we want to return to some semblance of normalcy in our lives, we can only hope that employers will mandate vaccinations for their workers to protect others, something that they remain able to do. Oren Spiegler Peters Township, Pa. Former President Donald Trump was thrilled to see his Supreme Court appointees overturn Biden’s vaccination mandate for businesses with 100+ employees. What Trump apparently doesn’t understand is that the majority of those dying from COVID are unvaccinated. This has ironically killed off some of his own base. Sharon Austry Fort Worth, Texas The Issue: Monica Crowley’s column on the possibility of Hillary Clinton running for office in 2024. Monica Crowley’s column about a possible return of Hillary Clinton in 2024 is interesting (“Clinton Comeback?” Post­Opinion, Jan. 13). She suggests that one possible path to glory for Clinton would be for her to be appointed to replace Kamala Harris. One fly in the ointment is that both the Senate and House must approve a VP nominee, and Democratic control of the Senate now exists only because Harris as VP can cast a deciding vote. Since a replacement VP can be nominated by the president only if the office is vacant, Harris would have to leave office first, and thus would no longer have the power as VP to vote on her replacement. James Peaslee Manhattan What has this country become that there is even a suggestion of Clinton running against Donald Trump in 2024? There has to be a better solution. Clinton will be 76 and Trump 77. Are there no younger, brighter, qualified politicians who can end the stalemate of the country being run by elderly people? Robert Henry Palm City, Fla.

11,Twitter bans account linked to Iran's supreme leader over Trump assassination threat,"Twitter permanently suspended an account linked to Iran’s supreme leader after it promoted a video depicting the assassination of former President Donald Trump, according to a report. ​”The account referenced has been permanently suspended for violating our ban evasion policy,” a Twitter spokesperson told​ Agence France-Presse on Saturday, referring to the account @KhameneiSite. The social media giant said its top priority is keeping people safe and protecting the health of conversations on the platform. The account, linked to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, posted an animated video of a drone last week targeting Trump as he is golfing near Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida. The clip called for revenge for the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Quds Force who was killed in a drone strike ordered by Trump near the Baghdad airport on Jan. 3, 2020. In the video, titled “Revenge is Definite,” a robot spots Trump playing golf with a small group and calls in a drone strike. Moments before the drone hits Trump, wearing a red cap, and what appears to be former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, they receive a text message that says: “Solemani’s murderer and the one who gave the order will pay the price.” Khamenei has repeatedly vowed to assassinate Trump over the killing of Iran’s top general. ​ The former president, who has been suspended by Twitter because of his posts about the Capitol riot, and his supporters have urged the platform to take action against Iran for calling for violence against Israel and the US. Other accounts associated with Khamenei are still online.",6.1
12,"Most Americans say Biden not focused enough on inflation, the economy: poll","A majority of Americans believe the Biden administration has not focused enough on the economy and inflation, and 50 percent say the president’s first year in office has left them feeling “frustrated,” a new poll released on Sunday shows. Fifty-eight percent say the Biden White House has not put enough attention on the economy and 65 percent say that about the administration’s handling of inflation, according to a CBS News/YouGov. poll. It found that 35 percent think Biden has put the right amount of focus on the economy, and 28 percent say he’s put the right amount of focus on inflation. Asked how the Biden presidency has made them feel, 50 percent of respondents say “frustrated,” 49 percent say “disappointed,” 40 percent say “nervous,” and 25 percent say “calm” and “satisfied.” Coming up to the end of Biden’s first year in office on Thursday, the poll shows his approval rating remains mired in the 40s, falling from a high of 62 percent in March to 44 percent in November, where it is now. His approval rating after the first year in office is lower than his six predecessors, except for former President Donald Trump, who registered 37 percent in 2018. Former President George W. Bush had the highest – 82 percent – in 2002. But while 55 percent of Americans say they like how Biden handles himself personally, 62 percent disapprove of how he’s handling the economy and 70 percent say they dislike his handling of inflation. Adding to their discontent is the fact that 39 percent of them say Biden and the Democrats are focusing on issues they “don’t care about.” Those who disapprove of Biden were asked what would improve their opinion of him – 63 percent say if Biden gets inflation under control and 24 percent say if his Build Back Better spending plan passes. But 76 percent say passing Build Back Better wouldn’t change their view of him and 37 percent say controlling inflation would not change their opinion of him. Of those who disapprove of Biden’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, 69 percent cite confusing information, 61 percent blame the president for promoting vaccine mandates, 47 percent say he was unprepared for the Omicron variant, and 43 percent say the number of cases aren’t falling enough. The poll surveyed 2,094 adults between Jan. 12-14. It has a plus/minus 2.5 percentage points margin of error.",8.1
13,Trump repeats claims that 2020 election was stolen at first rally of new year,"Former President Donald Trump held his first political rally of the new year in Arizona on Friday, continuing to insist that he had won the 2020 election without evidence. At the large rally in Florence, Ariz., Trump again claimed that he had actually won the state in 2020, despite having lost to Joe Biden 49.4 percent to 49.1 percent. Trump won the state handily in 2016 against Hillary Clinton by over 4 percentage points. “I love Arizona. We had a tremendous victory in Arizona that was taken away and I just want to wish everybody a happy New Year. We’re going to have, I think, a great year,” Trump said shortly after taking the stage to loud cheers. “Last year we had a rigged election and the proof is all over the place,” he continued. “We have a lot of proof and they know it’s proof. They always talk about the Big Lie — they’re the Big Lie.” “The Big Lie is a lot of bull****, that’s what it is,” he said to more cheers. The ex-president’s claims came one day after officials from Arizona’s second-largest county concluded that none of the 151 cases they reviewed merited criminal charges. “While PCAO’s investigation documented instances of these voters knowingly submitting more than one ballot, there is little to no evidence that they acted with the awareness that their actions would or could result in multiple votes being counted,” said Pima County Attorney Laura Conover in a statement on Friday. “What our investigation revealed was the genuine confusion about the electoral process, particularly relating to mail-in and provisional ballots, and the genuine fear, for a variety of reasons, that their initial vote would not count.” According to an investigation by the Associated Press, fewer than 200 cases of potential fraud in Arizona had been identified until last week, when election officials in  Maricopa County — the state’s largest — said they had discovered 38 potential voting fraud cases during an exhaustive review of 2.1 million ballots. Those cases were sent to the state attorney general’s office for review. Trump also mentioned the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill rioters, whom he said were being “persecuted” for expressing their First Amendment rights when they disrupted congress’ certification of the electoral votes that would officially make Biden president. “On top of it all, people are being persecuted for using freedom of speech to talk about the corrupt election but more and more information is coming out and it’s coming out far worse than anyone ever thought it could be.” He said, “it would be a lot easier for me to go out and enjoy my life and say ‘you know what? we did great.’ You know I ran twice and I won twice and we did better the second time,” he claimed. Earlier in the week, Trump abruptly ended an interview with National Public Radio after the outlet pressed him on his repeated claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him by voter fraud. At the desert rally, he threw his support behind GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who pushed Trump’s stolen election narrative and has threatened to throw the state’s top election official in prison. Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, a vehement Trump supporter and 2020 election results denier, also took the stage. Gosar was was censured by House Dems and stripped of his committee assignments in November after he tweeted a video depicting himself as an anime character assassinating progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking President Biden.",9.1
14,"'SNL' returns and takes aim at Joe Biden, Eric Adams in NYC-centric show","NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” returned to the airwaves for the first time since Dec. 18, with a fake President Joe Biden blaming the COVID-19 surge that sidetracked its last episode on the new Spider-Man movie. The show deployed plenty of New York-centric humor after its month-long break — including its first spoof of Mayor Eric Adams — and featured Ariana DeBose of “West Side Story” as host. The screen and stage actress said she was representing Broadway and launched into a medley of tunes from the show like “Tonight Tonight,” “I Feel Pretty” and “America” with Kate McKinnon. “Not many people know this but “West Side Story” is actually based on another classic tale of star-crossed lovers: “90 Day Fiancé,” she cracked during her monologue. Impressionist James Austin Johnson started the show portraying Biden holding a press conference at the White House, telling the country that the Omicron surge was tied to attendance of “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” for which he couldn’t get tickets. “Everyone in America has seen ‘Spider-Man’ like eight times. Everyone in America also has COVID. Stop seeing ‘Spider-Man,'” he urged the American people “This virus has disrupted our lives, canceled holidays, weddings, quinceañeras, gender-reveal parties, wildfires that started as gender reveal parties… whatever the hell is happening with Novak Djokovic,” Johnson said. “I know you’re tired of getting emails from your kids’ school late at night saying ‘ok come in tomorrow we’re feeling lucky.'” The skit took a bizarre turn when Pete Davidson emerged from a smoky portal dressed as a sunglass-wearing tough-guy action hero to announce he is actually President Biden and the current world is an alternate universe. “I am Joe Biden from the real universe. The timeline you’re all living in is about to collapse. You see it was created as a joke starting in 2016 when the Chicago Cubs won the World Series,” Davidson said, using a voice deepening effect. “Everyone is better off in the real world except for one man named Pete Davidson,” he cracked to White House reporters, alluding to his high-profile love life. “Your world is maybe more fun for him.” Another COVID-19 themed sketch spoofed TNT’s NBA coverage, where the Nets were beating the Kings 268-1 at halftime because the entire Sacramento squad came down with the virus. “You can see how the Kings’ lack of NBA players is reflected in the score,” Chris Redd’s Kenny Smith pointed out, as Mikey Day and DeBose portrayed overwhelmed amateur ballers who got called up to the big leagues to face Brooklyn. In a fake commercial, the show lampooned the seemingly endless stream of television reboots by previewing an updated “Family Matters” that starred Redd as a criminal Steve Urkel whose tagline is still “Did I do that?,” and Kenan Thompson as calming influence Carl Winslow. Davidson and Chloe Fineman spoofed obnoxious local mom-and-pop New York-area commercials by playing a heavily accented couple that run a “Formal Emporium” and offer up their nerdy son (Andrew Dismukes) as a date to high school formals to parents worried about keeping their daughters’ virginity intact. “We got dresses that are as pretty as she is, eh depending on the girl,” a heavily made-up Fineman promised. “If you’re worried about your daughter having sex after the dance, don’t be — we have the perfect solution,” Davidson’s smarmy character offered. “She can take our son Donovan, because Donavon wouldn’t know where to start,”  Fineman added, as the outer-borough couple went on to describe just how pathetic their son is. In another hyper-local reference, the show spoofed local cable news outlet NY1’s propensity for carrying mundane press conferences from local politicians in their entirety. Redd impersonated Mayor Eric Adams strutting to the podium at City Hall to the tune of“Feel So Good,” by Mase. “The city’s never had a mayor with so much swagger before,” the fake mayor told the press corps. “I mean y’all see me outside — the peacoats, the scarfs, the shine on the bald head yo!,” Redd said, playing up Adam’s Brooklyn accent. “You can tell I have swagger. Keeps me healthy. See the city’s been suffering from what I like to call a swag-less existence,” he cracked. “I’m muscular, I’m vegan and I get that thang-thang every day before breakfast,” the imitation mayor bragged. When the gaggle of reporters tried to speak over each other, the mayor snapped back. “I do not do chaos in my city. I told y’all that,” Redd said. “I was a police officer for over 70 years. If I get startled I start kicking people’s asses,” he promised. “And excuse me, this man he is not Bill de Blasio, he will kick your ass. Oh my god,” DeBose interjected, playing his secretary. “She’s joking but she’s from the Bronx so is she?,” Redd-as-Adams asked the assembled reporters, who he gave nicknames like Princess Peach and Slim Shady. “Weekend Update” took on politicians from both sides of the aisle and featured a GIF-worthy Elmo impersonation from Fineman, who was feuding with an imaginary Sesame Street friend. “Just like everybody else, President Biden’s New Year’s resolutions fell apart in the third week of January,” Colin Jost said. “The Supreme Court struck down his vaccine mandate, his voting rights bill got blocked and his approval rating is so low it’s gone into power save mode.” The fake anchor pointed out that the late convicted killer Robert Durst was now “New York’s fourth-worst real estate heir,” he said, after Donald Trump’s children Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka. The comedian also took aim at Prince Andrew being stripped of his royal titles amid underage sex abuse charges. “It’s an unprecedented case of an adult stripping Prince Andrew,” he cracked. DeBose and McKinnon spoofed another Broadway classic, with a topical take on “Do-Re-Mi” from “The Sound of Music.” Jack Antonoff’s New York City-based indie pop outfit Bleachers performed lively saxophone-filled renditions of their songs “How Dare You Want More,” and “Chinatown” after previously scheduled artist Roddy Ricch pulled out of the show because of exposure to COVID-19. SNL alumni Will Forte is slated to host next week’s episode with musical guest Måneskin.",4.8
15,Majority of Americans believe US democracy 'at risk of extinction': poll,"A majority of Americans now believe democracy in the United State is in danger of disappearing, according to a troubling new poll. Just 26% of those surveyed said they felt US democracy would be secured for future generations, while 51% agreed with the statement, “U.S. democracy is at risk of extinction.” An additional 23% said they were unsure, according to data from Schoen Cooperman Research. The fear of extinction fell evenly along partisan lines with 49% of Democrats and 49% of Republicans agreeing the republic was in danger. They were joined by 54% of independents. The polling showed widespread pessimism and distrust had increased through 2021. Just 54% of Americans said they believed Joe Biden was the legitimate winner of the presidential election. That figure was 64% when the same pollsters asked the question in April. The December poll also showed that 47% of American believed “there were real cases of fraud in the 2020 election that changed the results.” The results were even more pronounced for those ages 18-29, with just 21% agreeing that US democracy was safe. “We found that Americans are losing faith in their democracy, arguably worse than ever before. They’re losing faith in elections, institutions, and the ability of democracy to survive. Everything is negative,” said pollster Carly Cooperman. The December survey was comprised of 800 likely 2022 midterm election voters — and both parties were quick to blame the other side for the loss of faith. “With Democrat attempts to radically change election laws, pack the Supreme Court, and unilaterally enact the largest expansion of federal government in 50 years, it’s no surprise that people have no faith in Democracy or our institutions. It’s exactly how Venezuela became a socialist country, and exactly what the U.S. is inching closer to under one party Democrat rule,” Republican Staten Island Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said. Democrats claimed former President Trump was to blame, for insisting without evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen through fraud. “We live in an age of distrust and disinformation. Trust and truth are as elusive as ever. In my view, democracy in America has no greater threat the Donald Trump,” Rep Ritchie Torres (D-Bronx) said, adding that he too was “pessimistic” about on the issue. A total of 85% of respondents said they were concerned about the rise of political extremism in the United States. While another 80% said they would prefer to see politicians work together rather than “remain true to their ideological beliefs.” Roughly 2/3 of voters said the country had become “more divided.” “Americans’ lack of appreciation for the greatness, yes greatness, of America and American democracy is the underlying condition here,” said chess grand master Gary Kasparov, who is now a pro-democracy advocate. “It’s not just MAGA, but the far left as well, saying that the system doesn’t work, that it’s always been broken and that it’s irreparable. Instead of trying to fix it, to improve it, which has always been the strength the US system, they act as though it’s not worth saving.”",3.7
16,Elizabeth Warren's inflation boogeyman and other commentary,"Libertarian: Sen. Warren’s Inflation Boogeyman Sen. Elizabeth Warren is calling for the use of antitrust laws to target grocery retailers, claiming when only a handful of them “dominate” the market, they can force high food prices on Americans while raking in “record profits,” notes Reason’s Joe Lancaster. Yet the senator “could hardly have picked a worse industry to use as an example: Grocery stores consistently have among the lowest profit margins of any economic sector.” In fact, “the entire retail grocery industry currently averages barely more than 1 percent in net profit.” If Warren really wishes to lower grocery prices, she needs to combat inflation “by paring back profligate government spending.”From the left: Toddler Parents’ Unique Burden Parents of kids under 5 have “a knife hanging over our heads,” moans Jaime Greene at Slate: Tots must still quarantine for 10 days if exposed to COVID, and “a 10-day quarantine is enough to break a person. . . . This is about claustrophobia, and monotony, and how the little things in the world that help parents stay sane — a library, a play date, running errands and dragging him along — are off the table when you’ve been exposed. He’s old enough to need friends and playmates, to need the blessed, skilled teachers who can guide a tiny human tornado through a day of activities and circling up and songs.” Worse is “how the world seems to have utterly forgotten we exist.” Pandemic journal: Joe Missed a Key Opportunity The Wall Street Journal’s editors are scratching their heads wondering why the Biden administration failed to order more treatments for COVID-19 sooner. On Tuesday, Team Biden put in for more of GlaxoSmithKline and Vir Biotechnology’s monoclonal antibody treatment and Pfizer’s antiviral Paxlovid. Alas, these treatments “will probably arrive after the Omicron COVID variant crests.” Yet “it was obvious even early in the pandemic that treatments were going to be critical to living with COVID.” The Biden folks could’ve taken a page out of the Trump administration’s playbook, accelerating orders for treatments as President Donald Trump did for vaccine development. Instead, it focused “relentlessly on masking, testing and vaccines with therapies as a fourth priority.” Living with endemic COVID means “therapies are crucial.” And having more therapies this winter “might have saved thousands of lives.” School beat: Dems Must Break Unions’ Grip Chicago’s “unlawful” teachers-union strike “exposed an indifference not just to science but to the emotional and academic well-being of more than 340,000 schoolchildren,” roar Bloomberg Opinion’s editors. “It also showed why President Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders need to break the grip of teachers unions over the country’s public schools — or risk irreversible damage to the students who can afford it least.” Biden “should’ve stood unequivocally” against the teachers and with Chicago’s students, “who’ve already suffered far too many interruptions in recent years due to labor disputes.” Yet he can and should still take other steps to curb union power: The pandemic’s impact on student learning has been “disastrous”; it’s “past time for Democratic leaders, starting with the president, to show whose side they’re on.” From the right: Biden’s ‘Trumpian’ Demagoguery “President Joe Biden delivered one of the most demagogic speeches of any modern president on Tuesday,” thunders John Fund at Spectator World. “You might say it even had Trumpian tones.” The president was pushing two bills to “nationalize the election process” and ban states from enacting their own voter-integrity laws, but the “outright lies and vicious smears” in this “embarrassing” spectacle “made my head spin.” Biden first claimed the Jan. 6 Capitol riot was a “coup,” which went well beyond the “usual hyperbole.” Then, “almost everything he said after that” — particularly regarding Georgia’s new voting law — “was either untrue, a distortion or blatant exaggeration.” Politics is often “rough and tumble,” with truth being “the first casualty,” but Biden’s distortions did “double damage coming from a presidential podium.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board",1.8
17,Billy Bush 'livid' over 'Today' snub in 70th anniversary video,"Billy Bush is said to be “livid” over his exclusion from a video aired Friday commemorating the 70-year history of the “Today” show. Bush was fired from “Today” in 2016 after footage leaked from his former show “Access Hollywood,” in which he engaged in lewd talk in an outtake with Donald Trump in 2005. The infamous tape ended Bush’s stint on NBC’s powerful morning show after a mere two months — and according to Bush himself, sent him down a spiral marked by months of heavy drinking, loafing on the couch and crying. On Friday, a 12- minute video celebrating “Today’s” 70-year anniversary only added insult to injury, a source said, noting that the tape included practically every talking head who worked on the show — even the disgraced Matt Lauer. Lauer, who was ousted from NBC in 2017 amid accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, appeared briefly a few times in the video — including one snippet of Lauer on 9/11 and another reporting from Egypt, standing in front of the Sphinx wearing khaki shorts and shades. “Billy was livid they included everyone except him,” a source close to Bush said. “When they chose to include Matt Lauer — who was accused of anally raping a young staff member while on a work trip — but chose not to include Billy, you know something is very wrong.” NBC declined to comment. Bush didn’t return requests for comment. Although Bush’s run on “Today” was short, sources noted that the video was thorough, including everyone from Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Craig Melvin and Al Roker to Carson Daly, Katie Couric, Ann Curry, Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel. The show even unearthed old black and white clips featuring the likes of Frank Blair,  John Chancellor and Barbara Walters. “It is like Billy never existed,” the source said, calling NBC a network of “mean girls.” But some insiders don’t feel so bad for the anchor, whose presence on “Today” was scant compared with Lauer’s 20-year career. The 50-year-old Bush, who is the nephew of the late president George H. Bush, has a “big ego” and “inflated sense of self,” a source sniffed. In TV circles, Bush, who now hosts entertainment show “Extra,” is called “Bully Bush” by some for his demanding ways. “The ‘Today’ show is like an old girlfriend he can’t quit,” the source said. “He’s obsessed. He needs to let it go.”",5.1
18,Biden didn't mean to offend senators by likening them to infamous racists: Psaki,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki claimed Friday that President Biden didn’t intend to offend senators by likening them to George Wallace, Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis — but simply meant to compare their actions to those of the infamous white supremacists. Psaki was pressed at her regular briefing about Biden’s fiery rhetoric at a Tuesday speech in Atlanta, which unsuccessfully sought to convince Democratic senators to set aside the 60-vote legislative filibuster and pass election reforms with a bare majority. “He is talking about Republicans that don’t agree with voting rights [bills] — he’s describing them as George Wallace, Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis,” said Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy. “What happened to the guy who, when he was elected, said, ‘To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemies’?” “I think everybody listening to that speech — who’s speaking on the level, as my mother would say — would note that he was not comparing them as humans,” Psaki responded. She added: “He was comparing the choice to those figures in history and where they’re going to position themselves as they determine whether they’re going to support the fundamental right to vote or not.” Biden’s speech described last year’s Capitol riot as a “coup” attempt and alleged that Republican-led states are passing voting restrictions to reduce participation because of former President Donald Trump’s claims of voter fraud, which were rejected by courts. “At consequential moments in history, they present a choice: Do you want to be the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?  Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?  Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?” Biden said. Davis was the first and only president of the Confederacy during the Civil War. Wallace, the longtime Alabama governor, famously stood in a doorway at the University of Alabama to block desegregation in 1963 and ran for president on a segregationist platform in 1968. Connor ordered police to violently disperse civil rights protesters in Birmingham, Ala., during the 1960s. Biden’s push for the election legislation flopped. On Thursday, Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) reiterated that they won’t support changes to filibuster rules to allow for the bill to pass without Republican support in the evenly divided Senate. Republicans blasted Biden’s speech, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) variously calling it a “rant,” “incoherent,” and “un-presidential” on the Senate floor Wednesday. “I have known, liked, and personally respected Joe Biden for many years. I did not recognize the man at that podium yesterday,” said McConnell, who added that Biden’s remarks amounted to “shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist unless he gets whatever he wants.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said that Biden was going “down the same tragic road taken by President Trump casting doubt on the reliability of American elections.” Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, voted to convict Trump in two Senate impeachment trials and harshly criticized him during the 2016 campaign. Romney said in his own Senate speech that Biden “said quite a number of things that simply weren’t true” in his Atlanta address and “accused a number of my good and principled colleagues in the Senate of having sinister, even racist inclinations.” The bills pushed by Biden include the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would force certain states to gain federal approval to make changes to election laws, responding to a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that reduced post-Civil Rights era oversight. The other, the Freedom to Vote Act, would make Election Day a holiday, force states to allow no-excuse mail-in voting and require that most jurisdictions allow 10 hours per day of early voting for two weeks before an election. That bill would bar states from requiring people to show ID to get a mail-in ballot. The legislation is designed to override laws such as one in Georgia that passed last year. That law doesn’t alter Election Day voting hours and expands early voting by adding a second mandatory Saturday. It also affirms that counties can open for early voting on two Sundays and allows counties to extend early voting hours beyond normal business hours. Democrats oppose provisions that require a photo ID to get an absentee ballot, shorten the window of time to vote absentee and allow state officials to take over local election offices in response to alleged misconduct.",3.6
19,Biden nominations for Fed board include first black woman,"President Joe Biden on Friday announced the nominations of three people for the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, including Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed and Treasury official, for the top regulatory slot and Lisa Cook, who would be the first black woman to serve on the Fed’s board. Biden also nominated Phillip Jefferson, an economist, dean of faculty at Davidson College in North Carolina and a former Fed researcher. The three nominees, who will have to be confirmed by the Senate, would fill out the Fed’s seven-member board. They would join the Fed at a particularly challenging time in which the central bank will undertake the delicate task of raising its benchmark interest rate to try to curb high inflation, without undercutting the recovery from the pandemic recession. On Wednesday, the government reported that inflation reached a four-decade high in December. If approved, Biden’s picks would significantly increase the Fed’s diversity. Cook and Jefferson would be just the fourth and fifth black governors in the Fed’s 108-year history. And for the first time, a majority of the board would consist of female appointees. In late November, Biden also nominated Jerome Powell for a second four-year term as Fed chair and chose Lael Brainard, a Fed board member, to be the vice chair. “This group will bring much needed expertise, judgment and leadership to the Federal Reserve while at the same time bringing a diversity of thought and perspective never seen before on the Board of Governors,” Biden said in a statement Friday. Raskin’s nomination to the position of Fed vice chair for supervision — the nation’s top bank regulator — will be welcomed by progressive senators and advocacy groups, who see her as likely to take a tougher approach to bank regulation than Randal Quarles, a Trump appointee who stepped down last month. She is also viewed as someone committed to incorporating climate change considerations into the Fed’s oversight of banks. For that reason, though, she has already drawn opposition from some Republican senators. A Harvard-trained lawyer, Raskin, 60, previously served on the Fed’s seven-member board from 2010 to 2014. President Barack Obama then chose her to serve as deputy Treasury secretary, the No. 2 job in the department. As Fed governors, Raskin, Cook, and Jefferson would vote on interest-rate policy decisions at the eight meetings each year of the Fed’s policymaking committee, which also includes the 12 regional Fed bank presidents. Raskin’s first term as a Fed governor followed her work as Maryland’s commissioner of financial regulation, when she oversaw the state’s banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Kathleen Murphy, CEO of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, worked with Raskin during Raskin’s stint as Maryland’s banking regulator from 2007 to 2010. Murphy led the Maryland bankers’ group during that time. Murphy said the state’s financial industry regarded her as a “strong regulator but a fair regulator.” “She has always had a very collaborative approach,” Murphy said. “She wanted to make sure all the voices were at the table when decisions were made.” Still, Raskin is likely to draw fire from critics for her progressive views on climate change and the oil and gas industry. Two years ago, in an opinion column in The New York Times, she criticized the Fed’s willingness to support lending to oil and gas companies as part of its efforts to bolster the financial sector in the depths of the pandemic recession. “The decisions the Fed makes on our behalf should build toward a stronger economy with more jobs in innovative industries — not prop up and enrich dying ones,” Raskin wrote, referring to oil and gas providers. On Thursday, Sen. Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, criticized Raskin for having “explicitly advocated that the Fed allocate capital by denying it to this disfavored sector.” Raskin is married to Rep. Jamie Raskin, a liberal Maryland Democrat who gained widespread visibility as a member of the House Judiciary Committee when it brought impeachment charges against President Donald Trump. Cook has been a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State since 2005. She was also a staff economist on the White House Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 to 2012 and was an adviser to the Biden-Harris transition team on the Fed and bank regulatory policy. Cook is best-known for her research on the impact of racial violence on African-American invention and innovation. A 2013 paper she wrote concluded that racially motivated violence, by undermining the rule of law and threatening personal security, depressed patent awards to Black Americans by 15% annually between 1882 and 1940 — a loss that she found also held back the broader U.S. economy. In an interview in October, Cook said that despite encouragement from prominent economists such as Milton Friedman and George Akerlof, she struggled for years to get the paper published. The major economics journals, she said, typically didn’t deal with “patents, or economic history, or anything that related to African-Americans.” Cook has also been an advocate for Black women in economics, a profession that is notably less diverse than other social sciences. In 2019, she co-wrote a column in The New York Times that asserted that “economics is neither a welcoming nor a supportive profession for women” and “is especially antagonistic to Black women.” To combat those problems, Cook has spent time mentoring younger Black women in economics, directing a summer program run by the American Economic Association, and won an award for mentoring in 2019. Jefferson, who grew up in a working-class family in Washington, D.C., according to an interview with the American Economic Association, has focused his research on poverty and monetary policy. In a 2005 paper, he concluded that the benefits of a hot economy from the reduction in unemployment among lower-skilled workers outweighed the costs, including the risk that companies would adopt automation once labor grew scarce.",7.1
